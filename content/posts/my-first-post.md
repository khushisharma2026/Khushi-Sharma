Hi, I am Khushi Sharma.

I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Science. This blog is part of my course, "_Becoming a Reflective Informative Scientist_ ", where we are encouraged not just to learn concepts, but to think, question and reflect on how we learn.
I am still exploring this field and trying to understand things step by step. 
Through this blog, I will share my learning experience, the challenges I face and how I grow during this course.
